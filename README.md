# Etch-a-Sketch
This is a simple application for mimicing the classic Etch-a-Sketch
toy, written in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The user can move 
their mouse across the gird to draw an image, where when the cursor 
mouses over a cell, it is changed from white to a randomly generated
hexadecimal color. 

Users can also select the length of the rows/columns, and a new gird 
is generated after the selection is made.

Live version is available [here](https://justin-k-ellis.github.io/etch-asketch/).
